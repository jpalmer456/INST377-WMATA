<h1><b>Title: MetroHelp</b></h1>

<b>Description:</b> 
Our project aims to equip users with information regarding rail lines and station information for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  (WMATA). This includes information regarding locations, times, and alerts.

<b>Target Browser:</b> 
We anticipate users to use Google Chrome due to its ease of use. It is also the most used browser among all other browsers like Safari and Microsoft Edge.

<h3><b>User Manual:</b></h3>
To get information about a specific station, users can click on the dropdown menu on the Home page and select a station. Once they click Submit, the station's name, address, weekday opening time, and weekend opening time will appear in the Station Information box below. If there are any elevator or escalator outages, an alert will appear in the Station Alert Information box. 

If there are any system-wide alerts such as station closures or line delays, that information will appear in the System Alert Information box on the right side of the Home page. 

The About page contains information about the development team, a list of current app functionalities, and plans for future development of MetroHelp. If a user has a complaint, a comment, or an idea of a function they'd like to see implemented, they can leave a comment in the comment box on the bottom right of the About page.
